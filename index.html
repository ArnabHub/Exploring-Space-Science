        It was named for a prominent Indian Astronomer and Mathematician of the 5th century CE. The satellite was assembled at Peenya, near Bangalore, but was launched from within the Soviet Union by a Russian-made rocket on April 19, 1975. 
        The 96.3 minute orbit had an apogee of 619 km and a perigee of 563 km, at an inclination of 50.7 degrees. Aryabhata was built by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) to conduct experiments in X-ray astronomy,
         aeronomics, and solar physics. The spacecraft was a 26-sided polygon 1.4 m in diameter. All faces (except the top and bottom) were covered with solar cells. A power failure halted experiments after 4 days in orbit. All signals from the spacecraft were lost after 5 days of operation.
         The satellite reentered the Earth’s atmosphere on 11 February 1992.</p>

      </h1>
      <p align="justify" class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) is an indigenously-developed expendable launch system of the ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization).
      It comes in the category of medium-lift launchers with a reach up to various orbits, including the Geo Synchronous Transfer Orbit, Lower Earth Orbit, and Polar Sun Synchronous Orbit.
      All the operations of PSLV are controlled from the Satish Dhawan Space Center, Sriharikota, east coast, India. PSLV has a four-stage system comprising a combination of solid and liquid-fuelled rocket stages. 
      The first stage at the very bottom is solid fuelled having six strap-on solid rocket boosters wrapped around it. Second stage is liquid fuelled whereas the third stage has a solid fuelled rocket motor. 
      At the fourth stage, the launcher uses a liquid propellant to boost in the outer space. The launch vehicle can be customised to fly in three different configurations according to the mission requirements 
      and weighs 229,000, 296,000 or 320,000 kg. The flagship launcher has a payload capacity of 1,050 kg for launching into the Geo Synchronous Transfer Orbit and 1,600 kg for the Polar Sun Synchronous Orbit. 
      Apart from the regular version, PSLV is used in its Core Alone configuration and an XL Version. Core Alone version is launched without six strap-on boosters and less propellant in its upper stage a configuration 
      specifically used in the missions featuring small payloads. The XL version is launched with extra propellant in the strap-on solid rocket boosters for increasing the payload capacity. 
      As of September 2015, 87 satellites have been successfully launched by PSLV including 51 foreign and 36 Indian satellites into various orbits. Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle was developed in the 1990s and has 
      become the Indian space mission's most reliable workhorse. The PSLV carried out its first mission in 1993 but its first successful outing was the next year. Some remarkable launches by PSLV are Chandrayaan-1 
      (First Indian lunar probe), Mangalyaan-1 (First Mars Orbiter Mission by India) and Astrosat (First Indian dedicated multi-wavelength space observatory).</p>

      The launch window was approximately 20 days long and started on 28 October 2013. The MOM probe spent about a month in Earth orbit, where it made a series of seven apogee-raising orbital manoeuvres before trans-Mars injection on 30 November 2013.
      After a 298-day transit to Mars, it was put into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014. Marking India's first venture into the interplanetary space, MOM will explore and observe Mars surface features, morphology, mineralogy and the Martian atmosphere.
      Further, a specific search for methane in the Martian atmosphere will provide information about the possibility or the past existence of life on the planet. The enormous distances involved in interplanetary missions present a demanding challenge;
      developing and mastering the technologies essential for these missions will open endless possibilities for space exploration. After leaving Earth, the Orbiter will have to endure the Interplanetary space for 300 days before Mars capture. 
      Apart from deep space communications and navigation-guidance-control capabilities, the mission will require autonomy at the spacecraft end to handle contingencies. Once India decided to go to Mars, ISRO had no time to lose as the nearest 
      launch window was only a few months away and it could not afford to lose the chance, given the next launch would present itself after over 780 days, in 2016. Thus, mission planning, manufacturing the spacecraft and the launch vehicle and readying the support systems took place swiftly. </p>

        Chandrayaan is Indian Lunar Exploration Programme. The first deep space mission Chandrayaan- 1 was launched on Oct. 22, 2008, from the Satish Dhawan Space Center in Sriharikota, 
        India, aboard a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket, according to NASA. The spacecraft initially performed its work from a mapping orbit at an altitude of 100 kilometers (62 miles), ISRO said. In May 2009, 
        controllers raised the orbit to 200 km (124 miles). Chandrayaan-1 made 3,400 orbits of the moon and continued transmitting data until Aug. 29, 2009, when controllers permanently lost communication with the spacecraft.
        It reached the moon on Nov. 8, 2008. The Chandrayaan-1 mission carried Moon Impact Prob payload that made contact with the Moon. The spacecraft released its Moon Impact Probe on Nov. 14, which crashed into the moon on the same day.
        The lunar orbiter is best known for helping to discover evidence of water molecules on the moon. <br>
        Scientific goals included the study of the chemical, mineralogical and photogeologic mapping of the Moon. In addition to the five Indian instruments,
        the spacecraft carried scientific equipment from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, and Bulgaria. It operated for almost a year (between October 2008 and August 2009).

        from Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), Sriharikota. After a series of Earth bound manoeuvres, the spacecraft entered into Lunar Transfer 
        Trajectory (LTT) on August 14th. Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI) manoeuvre was performed on August 20th, thereby Chandrayaan-2 was successfully inserted into the elliptical orbit around the Moon. This was followed by a series of Lunar bound orbit maneuvers for reducing the orbit to circular polar orbit around the Moon. On September 2nd, Vikram lander separated from the Orbiter and de-orbiting
        maneuver was performed to reduce the orbit to 35 km x 101 km. Vikram landing was attempted on 7th September and it followed the planned descent trajectory from its orbit of 35 km to around 2 km above the surface. Communication with lander and ground station was lost. All the systems and sensors of the Lander functioned excellently until this point and proved many new technologies such as variable thrust propulsion technology used in the Lander.<br> However, the Orbiter is healthy and all the payloads are operational. Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter is currently in a 100 km x 100 km orbit around the Moon, carries 8 experiments for studies ranging from surface geology and composition to exospheric measurements that would continue to build upon the understanding from 
        previous lunar missions. Just before Vikram was to touch down on the Moon, contact was lost at an altitude of 2 km (1.2 miles).

        IRNSS is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system being developed by ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization). The government of India approved the project in May 2006, 
        with the intention of the system to be completed and implemented in the timeframe 2016. It is designed to provide accurate position information service to users in India as well as the 
        region extending up to 1500 km from its boundary, which is its primary service area. An Extended Service Area lies between primary service area and area enclosed by the rectangle from 
        Latitude 30 deg South to 50 deg North, Longitude 30 deg East to 130 deg East. IRNSS will provide two types of services, namely, Standard Positioning Service (SPS) which is provided to 
        all the users and Restricted Service (RS), which is an encrypted service provided only to the authorised users. The IRNSS System is expected to provide a position accuracy of better than 
        20 m in the primary service area.

         inaugurating the space age. The launch of Sputnik in 1957 signaled not only Soviet Technical leadership in a new field but 
         also the capability and extent of Soviet large missile development and production. This leadership persisted into the era of 
         manned spaceflight, and, exploiting a minimalistic but sophisticated approach to technology, it continued in the pioneering 
         era of space vehicles and space stations. This historic image shows a technician putting the finishing touches on Sputnik 1, 
         Humanity's First Artificial Satellite. The pressurized sphere made of aluminum alloy had five primary scientific objectives: 
         Test the method of placing an artificial satellite into Earth orbit; 
         provide information on the density of the atmosphere by calculating its lifetime in orbit; test radio and optical methods of orbital tracking; 
         determine the effects of radio wave propagation though the atmosphere; and, check principles of pressurization used on the satellites. </p>

        The Vostok 3KA space capsule was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome on April 12, 1961, with Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin aboard, 
        making him the first human to cross into outer space.
        The voyage, which began with launch at 9:07 am Moscow time, entailed one orbit around Earth, lasting 1 hour 29 minutes, 
        and ended at 10:55 am in the Soviet Union with his safe return to Earth. It also brought Gagarin immediate worldwide fame.
        The Vostok spacecraft was designed to eject the cosmonaut at approximately 7 km and allow him to return to earth by parachute. 
        Although initial reports made it unclear whether Gagarin landed in this manner or returned in the spacecraft, subsequent reports 
        confirmed that he did indeed eject from the capsule. </p>

          Salyut 1 was the World's First Space Station launched into low Earth orbit by the Soviet Union on April 19, 1971.
          The Soviet Union's space station design took the form of a stepped cylinder 14.6 metres (48 feet) long, with its 
          widest section 4.25 metres (13.9 feet) in diameter. At the front end was a docking system for Soyuz ferries. 
          Internally, apart from an air lock in the cylindrical front section, the station formed a single rectangular room. 
          The name of the station program 'Salyut', was chosen to honour cosmonaut Yury Gagarin's historic first orbit of 
          Earth a decade earlier. Salyut 1, which was launched April 19, 1971, atop a Proton rocket, was two three-man crews
          for a total of two months over a six-month period. The Salyut program followed this with five more successful launches 
          of seven more stations.</p>

          On June 16, 1963, at the age of 26, Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman to fly in space. 
          Before becoming a cosmonaut, Tereshkova was a textile factory worker and avid skydiver. 
          Her three-day mission was the 12th human spaceflight in history, following several Russian Vostok and American Mercury flights.
          Strapped to her ejection seat, Tereshkova rode inside the 7.5-foot-wide pressurized cabin of Vostok-6. 
          She was carried into orbit by an R-7 booster rocket. The Vostok 6 landing site was 200 km west of Barnaul, 
          Russia and 7 km south of Baevo and 650 km northeast of Karagandy, Kazakhstan. <br>
          The capsule is now on display at the RKK Energia Museum in Russia. <br>
          This was the final Vostok flight of Russian space exploration programmes.

          On the 15th of December 1970 something momentous happened. Venera 7 was launched on 17th August 1970 at 
          05:38:22 UT into an Earth parking orbit and a Tyazheliy Sputnik towards Venus. 
          Venera 7 a lander, made the first successful soft touchdown on another planet and transmitted for 23 minutes.
          Venera 7 did successfully fire its escape-stage rocket engine to begin the nearly four-month cruise to Venus.
          The Venera 7 probe separated from the bus and entered the nightside atmosphere of Venus on December 15, 1970.
          Venera 7 was designed to enter the atmosphere of Venus, deploy a parachute to slow its fall toward the surface. 
          But, the parachute ripped and collapsed during the descent, leaving Venera 7 in freefall for 29 minutes before 
          it slammed into the Venusian surface.

         After departing Earth on December 4, 1996, Mars Pathfinder didn't reach its namesake until July 4, 1997. 
         When the 23-pound Sojourner rover reached Mars, becoming the first to ever reach another planet, 
         it explored the Ares Vallis area of the red planet and analyzed its atmosphere, climate, and geology. 
         There were concerns about how to land safely on Mars, but a creative approach that surrounded the rover 
         in airbags was successful. The mission brought in evidence suggesting that Mars once had flowing water 
         and that the atmosphere is heated by the planet's surface. Sojourner spent 83 days of a planned seven-day 
         mission exploring the Martian terrain, snapping photographs and taking chemical, atmospheric and other measurements.
         Sojourner made its final transmission in September, but by then it was already considered a great success.

          Cassini-Huygens is an U.S.- European space mission to Saturn, launched on October 15, 1997. The mission consisted of the U.S. National 
          Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) Cassini orbiter, which was the first space probe to orbit Saturn, and the European Space 
          Agency’s (ESA's) Huygens probe, which landed on Titan, Saturn’s largest moon. The orbiter had a mass of 2,150 kg, the probe 350 kg. 
          With the launch vehicle adapter and 3,132 kg of propellants at launch, the spacecraft had a mass of 5,600 kg. The Cassini spacecraft 
          was 6.8 meters (22 ft) high and 4 meters (13 ft) wide. Cassini was named for the French astronomer Gian Domenico Cassini, 
          who discovered four of Saturn’s moons and the Cassini division, a large gap in Saturn’s rings. Huygens was named for the Dutch scientist 
          Christiaan Huygens, who discovered Saturn’s rings and Titan.

          The International Space Station (ISS) is a modular space station in low Earth orbit. It is a multinational collaborative project 
          involving five participating space agencies: NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japan), ESA (Europe), and CSA (Canada).
          The use of the space station is established by inter-governmental treaties and agreements. <br>
          The first pieces of the International Space Station (ISS), one from Russia and the other from the United States, left Earth in the 
          fall of 1998. The two were attached in space and added on to piece by piece until November 2, 2000, when the first crew arrived.
          The station serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory in which scientific research is conducted in astrobiology, 
          astronomy, meteorology, physics, and other fields. On board the ISS, astronauts from all over the world continue to work on all sorts of 
          experiments, including exploration of the effects microgravity has on the human body. In this test, they're the guinea pigs. 
          Adjustments, both mechanical and diplomatic, have been required over time, yet the crew and politicians at home recently celebrated 
          over 20 years of orbiting the Earth, and in 2018, legislation was approved to extend ISS operations through 2030. </p>
